# Day 00 - Piscine SQL

## _Relational Data Model and SQL_

Resume: Today you will see how relational model works and how to get needed data based on basic constructions of  SQL


- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database.

![schema](misc/images/schema.png)


1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restaurant (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

## Exercise 00 - First steps into SQL world

| Exercise 00: First steps into SQL world |                                                                  

Let’s make our first task.

| Exercise 02: First steps into SQL world |                                                                  

Please make 2 syntax different select statements which return a list of pizzerias (pizzeria name and rating) with rating between 3.5 and 5 points (including limit points) and ordered by pizzeria rating.
- the 1st select statement must contain comparison signs  (<=, >=)
- the 2nd select statement must contain `BETWEEN` keyword


## Exercise 03 - First steps into SQL world

| Exercise 03: First steps into SQL world |

Also include ordering clause by person identifier in descending mode.

## Exercise 04 - First steps into SQL world

Please make a select statement which returns one calculated field with name ‘person_information’ in one string like described in the next sample:

`Anna (age:16,gender:'female',address:'Moscow')`

Finally, please add the ordering clause by calculated column in ascending mode.
Please pay attention to quote symbols in your formula!

## Exercise 05 - First steps into SQL world


| Exercise 05: First steps into SQL world |                                                                                                                            **Denied**                               |                                           
| SQL Syntax Construction                        | `IN`, any types of `JOINs`                                                                                              |

Please make a select statement which returns person's names (based on internal query in `SELECT` clause) who made orders for the menu with identifiers 13 , 14 and 18 and date of orders should be equal 7th of January 2022. Be aware with "Denied Section" before your work.

Please take a look at the pattern of internal query.

    SELECT 
	    (SELECT ... ) AS NAME  -- this is an internal query in a main SELECT clause
    FROM ...
    WHERE ...


## Exercise 06 - First steps into SQL world


| Exercise 06: First steps into SQL world |                                                                                                                         
**Denied**                               |                                           
| SQL Syntax Construction                        | `IN`, any types of `JOINs`                                                                                              |

Please use SQL construction from Exercise 05 and add a new calculated column (use column's name ‘check_name’) with a check statement (a pseudo code for this check is presented below) in the `SELECT` clause.

    if (person_name == 'Denis') then return true
        else return false


## Exercise 07 - First steps into SQL world


| Exercise 07: First steps into SQL world |                                                                 

Let’s apply data intervals for the `person` table. 
Please make a SQL statement which returns a person's identifiers, person's names and interval of person’s ages (set a name of a new calculated column as ‘interval_info’) based on pseudo code below. 

    if (age >= 10 and age <= 20) then return 'interval #1'
    else if (age > 20 and age < 24) then return 'interval #2'
    else return 'interval #3'

and yes...please sort a result by ‘interval_info’ column in ascending mode.

| SQL Syntax Construction                        | any types of `JOINs`                                                                                              |


Please make a select statement that returns person names and pizzeria names based on the `person_visits` table with date of visit in a period from 07th of January to 09th of January 2022 (including all days) (based on internal query in `FROM` clause) .


Please take a look at the pattern of the final query.

    SELECT (...) AS person_name ,  -- this is an internal query in a main SELECT clause
            (...) AS pizzeria_name  -- this is an internal query in a main SELECT clause
    FROM (SELECT … FROM person_visits WHERE …) AS pv -- this is an internal query in a main FROM clause
    ORDER BY ...

Please add a ordering clause by person name in ascending mode and by pizzeria name in descending mode
